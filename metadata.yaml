description: It's hard trying to develop into a real Writer Lady in the bosom of one's
  family, especially when the family refuses to take one seriously. Seven years of
  newspaper grind have taught Dawn O'Hara the fallacy of trying to write by the inspiration
  method. But there is such a thing as a train of thought, and hers is constantly
  being derailed, and wrecked and pitched about.
